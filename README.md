# TikTok_scrape (outdated and bad)
[This is crazy outdated. yt-dlp supports tiktok now.]


A python tiktok scraper tool for linux systems. 

As of right now the script is using selenium to scroll through a page, like on an actual browser, like how a human would. This is primitive as hell, so I'm gonna try and find a way to use curl. If yt-dlp updates their tiktok downloading this will be totally obsolete. 

||| Before attempting to use, download python, selenium, chrome, and yt-dlp |||


To use:

- run account through scrape.py 

- run the output through reformat.py

- yt-dlp --batch-download sorted_links.txt
